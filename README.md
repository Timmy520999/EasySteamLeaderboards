## 2. Configuration
    * Configure your leaderboard data in the Steamworks backend.
    * (You may refer to external tutorials for this step, as it is assumed you are already familiar with Steamworks setup.)

## 3. Use Upload Steam Leaderboards Nodes
    * In any Blueprint where you want to implement logic, right-click and search for Easy Steam Leaderboards, then select Upload Steam Leaderboards.

## 4. Input Parameters:

    * Steam Ranking Name: Enter the leaderboard name configured in your Steamworks backend.

    * Score: The player's in-game score or the value to add/subtract.

    * Detail Array (Max8 Int32): Create an array to store additional metadata (maximum of 8 Int32 entries). Examples: country code, timestamp, age, level, etc.

    * Upload Score Type: Choose between Forced Update Score (overwrite) or Keep Best Score (retain highest).

    * Upload Score Method: Select Change Score (directly modify), Add Score (increment), or Subtract Score (decrement).

## 5. Output Parameters:

    * Steam Upload Result: Use Break UploadLeaderboardResultData to extract post-upload player information.

## 6. Optional Nodes:

    * Get Player Country Letter Code and ESL Get Country INFO nodes allow fetching player nationality data (country name, numeric/letter codes, flag images).

    Note: Flag images require separate asset purchases (e.g., from FAB) and configuration in the plugin's DataTable.

## 7. Flag Configuration (Optional)
    * To use national flags:

    Navigate to the pluginâ€™s content directory and edit DT_Countries_Code to configure flag icons.

    Flags are not included in the plugin due to licensing (third-party assets on FAB).
